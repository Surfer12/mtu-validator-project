‚Ä¢ **Performance Optimization** with caching and async operations

### üöÄ Ready to Use
The project is now ready for:
1. Development: All source files organized and documented
2. Building: Maven configuration with Java 24 support
3. Testing: Comprehensive test suite structure
4. Deployment: CLI tool and library distribution
5. Extension: Clear architecture for adding Windows 11 support

### üìÅ Project Location
All files are organized in: /Users/ryandavidoates/mtu-validator-project/

The project follows enterprise-grade standards with comprehensive documentation, 
security best practices, and a clear roadmap for Windows 11 AMD64 support in version 
1.1.0.

You can now proceed with Maven installation and building the project using the provided
build scripts and documentation!
