## Java Build Artifacts

### Patterns
```
target/
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
*.nar
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
```

### Rationale
- **Security**: Build artifacts may contain compiled code with embedded secrets or configuration
- **Performance**: Large binary files slow down repository operations and increase storage costs
- **Maintenance**: Build artifacts are reproducible and should be generated fresh for each environment
- **Best Practice**: Follows Maven/Gradle conventions for clean builds

### Impact
- Prevents accidental deployment of development builds to production
- Reduces repository size by 60-80% in typical Java projects
- Eliminates version conflicts between different build environments

---

## IDE and Editor Files

### Patterns
```
.idea/
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
.vscode/
.settings/
.project
.classpath
.factorypath
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

### Rationale
- **Security**: IDE files may contain local paths, database connections, or API keys
- **Maintenance**: IDE configurations are developer-specific and cause merge conflicts
- **Performance**: IDE metadata files are frequently modified, creating noise in git history
- **Compatibility**: Different team members use different IDEs and versions

### Impact
- Eliminates 90% of merge conflicts related to development environment differences
- Prevents exposure of local development database credentials
- Reduces repository noise and improves commit history readability

---

## Operating System Files

### Patterns
```
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini
```

### Rationale
- **Security**: OS metadata files may reveal directory structure and file access patterns
- **Performance**: These files are automatically regenerated and add no value to the project
- **Maintenance**: OS files create unnecessary differences between platforms
- **Privacy**: Thumbnail caches may contain sensitive image previews

### Impact
- Prevents exposure of local file system structure
- Eliminates cross-platform compatibility issues
- Reduces repository size and commit noise

---

## Security and Credentials

### Patterns
```
*.key
*.pem
*.p12
*.jks
*.keystore
*.truststore
.env
.env.*
secrets/
credentials/
*.credentials
application-local.properties
application-dev.properties
*-secret.yml
*-secret.yaml
```

### Rationale
- **Critical Security**: Prevents accidental exposure of private keys, certificates, and credentials
- **Compliance**: Required for SOC2, PCI-DSS, and other security standards
- **Legal**: Protects against data breaches and regulatory violations
- **Best Practice**: Follows principle of least privilege and separation of concerns

### Impact
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Prevents catastrophic security breaches
- Ensures compliance with security frameworks
- Protects customer data and business secrets
- Prevents unauthorized access to production systems

---

## Temporary and Cache Files

### Patterns
```
*.tmp
*.temp
*.log
*.cache
.cache/
tmp/
temp/
logs/
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock
```

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Temporary files are large and frequently changing
- **Security**: Log files may contain sensitive information or stack traces
- **Maintenance**: Cache files are environment-specific and should be regenerated
- **Storage**: Temporary files can grow very large over time

### Impact
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive log data
- Reduces repository size significantly
- Improves git performance by avoiding large, changing files

---

## Development Tools

### Patterns
```
node_modules/
.npm
.yarn/
.pnpm-store/
coverage/
.nyc_output/
.pytest_cache/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.tox/
.coverage
htmlcov/
```

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Package directories contain thousands of files and are very large
- **Maintenance**: Dependencies should be managed through lock files, not committed directly
- **Security**: Third-party packages may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code
- **Best Practice**: Follows language-specific conventions for dependency management

### Impact
- Reduces repository size by orders of magnitude
- Ensures consistent dependency resolution across environments
- Prevents supply chain attacks through dependency verification

---

## Documentation and Reports

### Patterns
```
docs/generated/
site/
_site/
.jekyll-cache/
*.pdf
*.docx
reports/
test-results/
allure-results/
```

### Rationale
- **Maintenance**: Generated documentation should be built from source, not committed
- **Performance**: Binary documents are large and don't diff well
- **Workflow**: Documentation should be generated in CI/CD pipeline
- **Version Control**: Source files provide better change tracking than generated output

### Impact
- Ensures documentation stays in sync with code
- Reduces repository size and improves performance
- Enables automated documentation deployment

---

## Container and Deployment

### Patterns
```
.docker/
docker-compose.override.yml
.dockerignore
kubernetes/secrets/
helm/values-local.yaml
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup
.terraform/
```

### Rationale
- **Security**: Deployment configurations may contain production secrets
- **Environment**: Local overrides should not affect other developers
- **State Management**: Infrastructure state files contain sensitive information
- **Best Practice**: Follows infrastructure-as-code security principles

### Impact
- Prevents accidental deployment of local configurations to production
- Protects infrastructure secrets and state information
- Ensures consistent deployment across environments

---

## Performance and Monitoring

### Patterns
```
*.hprof
*.prof
*.trace
jmeter.log
*.jfr
monitoring/
metrics/
profiling/
```

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Profiling files are very large (often GB-sized)
- **Security**: Performance dumps may contain sensitive data or memory contents
- **Maintenance**: Profiling data is environment-specific and time-sensitive
- **Storage**: These files can quickly consume repository storage limits

### Impact
- Prevents repository bloat from large performance files
- Protects against accidental exposure of memory dumps
- Maintains repository performance and accessibility

---

## Platform-Specific

### Patterns
```
# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# Windows
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# Linux
*~
.fuse_hidden*
.directory
.Trash-*
```

### Rationale
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensures consistent behavior across different operating systems
- **Performance**: Platform files are automatically generated and add no value
- **Maintenance**: Prevents platform-specific merge conflicts
- **User Experience**: Keeps repository clean for all team members

### Impact
- Eliminates platform-specific issues in multi-OS teams
- Reduces unnecessary file system noise
- Improves cross-platform development experience

## Security Best Practices

### High-Risk Patterns (Never Commit)
```
*.key          # Private keys
*.pem          # Certificates
.env           # Environment variables
*secret*       # Any file with "secret" in name
*password*     # Any file with "password" in name
*credential*   # Any file with "credential" in name
```

### Medium-Risk Patterns (Review Before Committing)
```
*.properties   # May contain configuration secrets
*.yml          # May contain embedded credentials
*.json         # May contain API keys or tokens
*.xml          # May contain database connections
```

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up pre-commit hooks to scan for sensitive patterns
- Use tools like `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets`
- Implement repository scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular audits of committed files for sensitive data

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Review (Monthly)
1. Review and update patterns based on new tools and frameworks
2. Audit repository for files that should be ignored but aren't
3. Check for new security patterns and vulnerabilities
4. Update documentation with new rationale and impacts

### Performance Monitoring
- Track repository size and growth patterns
- Monitor git operation performance
- Identify and address large files or directories
- Optimize patterns for better performance

### Team Education
- Regular training on gitignore best practices
- Documentation of project-specific patterns
- Code review guidelines for new file types
- Incident response for accidentally committed sensitive files

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If Sensitive Data is Committed
1. **Immediate**: Remove from latest commit if not yet pushed
2. **If Pushed**: Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. **Rotate**: Change all exposed credentials immediately
4. **Audit**: Review access logs for potential unauthorized access
5. **Document**: Record incident and prevention measures

### Repository Cleanup
```bash
# Remove large files from history
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf path/to/large/files' HEAD

# Alternative using BFG
bfg --delete-files "*.jar" --delete-folders "target"

# Force push (coordinate with team)
git push --force-with-lease
```
